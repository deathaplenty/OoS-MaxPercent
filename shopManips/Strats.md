Consecutive rounds will depend on what ring you get in the round before, so routing consecutive rounds will take even more tree searching. It would be worth it when it comes to speed though

Perhaps deep tree traversal should be the first strat to get as many rings without duplicates first and then shallow tree traversal for remaining rings
